## Description ##

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat.

When you start a Breach Protocol, you’ll enter a kind of puzzle minigame.

There are several things going on here.

First, there’s a time limit in the upper left — Breach Time Remaining — but this doesn’t start ticking down until you choose your first character from the Code Matrix, the grid of character pairs below the timer. The Almost In perk under the Intelligence > Breach Protocol Skill will give you more time.

Next, in the center along the top, there’s your Buffer. This is the maximum number of characters you can choose. You don’t have to (and often won’t) choose that many, but the size of your buffer is the max. You’ll start with four Buffer slots. To get more Buffer slots, you’ll need to buy and install a new Cyberdeck from a ripperdoc.

On the right hand side, you’ll see the list of Daemons available to upload. Each Daemon comes with a sequence of characters that you’ll need to slot into your Buffer — in order — to upload it and gain its effect.

When you start selecting characters from the matrix, you have to start in the first row. You can select any character across that top row. The next character you select has to be in the same column as the first character you selected. The third has to be in the same row as the second. The fourth has to be in the same column as the third. That sequence of alternating between row and column keeps repeating from there.
